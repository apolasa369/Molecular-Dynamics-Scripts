# Drug-Discover-Pipeline
The Protein_preparation code conatains How to obtain traget compounds from CHEMBl.

In addition, multiple classification algorithms were built to distinguish between active and inactive compounds from the chembl based on the IC50 value, 
and a random forest prediction ML algorithm was utilized to forecast future pIC50 values for test compounds. 

For more reggors analysis of chemicals based on docking scores, a sample Autodock python script is also supplied.
