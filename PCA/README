for PCA analysis please download the prody software beforehand from following wesite http://prody.csb.pitt.edu

for more details on the topic PCA please review the following article https://www.pnas.org/content/106/34/14349.full

Also require python installed for this analysis

first run the indices.sh to generate indivual index file for the PDB atom numbers

following the index genration we need to generate indiviual dcd files for each selection to run

strip.sh #generates new dcds files used for PCA

Keeping only CA atoms speeds up the calculations.
This script will first extract all CA atoms from a bunch of dcd files and then combines them in one dcd file
You need to modify the loop to go over all your dcd files.


then make chages in eda.py file with resepective pdb and dcd files also change the output file names every time you run this anlysis for various selections

and run ed.sh file

This script uses prody python package to do pca over CA atoms.
You should first install prody and give the right address in eda.sh file
It gives projection of all frames onto 20 first pca's (you can change 20)
It also tells you what the portion of each pca is (explains what fraction of variance)

run files in the following order 

./indices.sh

./strip.sh

./ed.sh
